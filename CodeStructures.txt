Some Codestructures:

To setup a new menu:

Menus  - Contains a list of pointers to the menu Items-structure, "Menunumber" is used to determine what menu to print. Begins with 0 for mainmenu.
MenuCode - Contains a list of pointers to where executable code is located after same order as "menunumber"
MenuKeys - Contains pointer to list of keyentries to trigger menuitems in same order as menunumber

Menuitemsstructure:
	Pointer to menuheadertext
	Pointers to menuitemtexts
	nullterminator tells end of menu.

MenuCode:
	Pointers to were the executeable code is in order from menu.

MenuKeys:
	one char telling what key to press to activate menuitem


IF doing a submenusystem, for handling variables etc after menuitems. Wite a pointer to where menu is located at "Menu-V(a6)"
at MenuVariable-V(a6) you store your pointer to where your variables is.
structure looks like: 
Word:  Color of string
Longword: Pointer to string to show after menuitem.
one per item.. if null is detected, no more variables will be printed.
you need to in your code jump to PrintMenu, then GetInput and handle the results yourself. check the "AudioSimple" for examplecode
"GetInput" will handle cursorkeys etc..
